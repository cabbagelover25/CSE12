In this PA, we created a Mailroom class that had the ability to sort through different Deliverables. To do this we had to make a Deliverables abstract class and two child classes of MyMail and MyPackage. Additionally, we implemented a MyQueue class structure in order to implement certain functions in the Mailroom, like retrieving the earliest Deliverables, sorting Deliverables by zipcode, and retrieving all items in the Mailroom.
