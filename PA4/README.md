Repository for CSE 12 projects

In this PA, we used the Stack class to implement the Stack data structure which
follows a Last In, First Out model. A good real life example of this would be
a set of books piled on top of each other, in that the book that is last placed
on top is the one that must first be removed. Our Stack class implementation was
then used for the ImageEditor class which implements basic image editor
functionality for a graysvale image and allows individual pixels to be deleted,
blurred, or sharpened, as well as for more advanced undo and redo functions.
